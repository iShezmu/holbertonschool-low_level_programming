# Project: C - Variables, if, else, while

*  0-positive_or_negative.c
   - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
     - The number, followed by
       - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
       - if the number is 0: `is zero`
       - if the number is les than 0: `is negative`
*  1-last_digit.c
   - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n`each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
     - The output of the program should be:
       - The string `Last digit of`, followed by
       - `n`, followed by
       - the string `is`, followed by
         -  if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
         -  if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
         -  if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
*  2-print_alphabet.c
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
*  3-print_alphabets.c
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
*  4-print_alphabt.c
   - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
     - Print all the letters except `q` and `e` 
*  5-print_numbers.c
   - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting form `0`, followed by a new line.
*  6-print_numberz.c
   - Write a program thta prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
     - You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
     - You can only use the `putchar` function twice in your code.
